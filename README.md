# GLPI Markdown Editor Plugin

A plugin for GLPI that adds markdown editing capabilities to text fields in the knowledge base and other text areas.

## Usage

### Basic Markdown Editing

1. Open any knowledge base article or text field with rich text editor

2. **Copy an image** from anywhere (screenshot, file, web page, etc.)
3. **Paste the image** (`Ctrl+V` / `Cmd+V`) into the markdown textarea
4. The image will be **automatically uploaded** to GLPI's file system
5. **Markdown syntax** for the image will be inserted: `![filename](url)`
6. **Toggle back to HTML mode** to see the image rendered
